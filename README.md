# Final-Evaluation-Visualization-Model-Saving
The model was evaluated using test data to check final accuracy and loss. Performance was analyzed using graphs and a confusion matrix. The trained model was saved in .h5 format, and all files were organized and uploaded to GitHub for final submission.

The trained model was thoroughly evaluated using unseen test data to measure its final accuracy and loss, ensuring proper generalization. Performance was further analyzed using accuracy graphs and a confusion matrix to understand prediction behavior. The finalized model was saved in .h5 format for future use, and all source code, documentation, and reports were systematically organized and uploaded to GitHub for successful project submission.
